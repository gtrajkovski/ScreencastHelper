# Data Drift Detection Tutorial

Topic: Detecting and Handling Data Drift in ML Pipelines

## Key Points
- What is data drift and why it matters for ML models
- Types of drift: feature drift, concept drift, prediction drift
- Using statistical tests to detect drift (KS test, PSI)
- Implementing drift detection with Evidently AI
- Setting up automated drift monitoring in production
- Best practices for responding to detected drift

## Demo Requirements
- Show: Loading a baseline dataset and production data
- Show: Running drift detection using Evidently
- Show: Generating a drift report with visualizations
- Data: Sample customer transaction data with intentional drift
- Output: HTML drift report, terminal validation output

## Target Audience
- Data scientists and ML engineers
- Intermediate level (familiar with Python and basic ML concepts)
