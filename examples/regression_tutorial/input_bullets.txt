# Linear Regression Deep Dive

Topic: Understanding and Implementing Linear Regression

## Key Points
- The math behind linear regression (gradient descent, cost function)
- Implementing from scratch vs using sklearn
- Feature scaling and its importance
- Evaluating model performance (R-squared, MSE, MAE)
- Handling multicollinearity
- When to use regularization (Ridge, Lasso)

## Demo Requirements
- Show: Building regression model step by step
- Show: Visualizing the fit with matplotlib
- Show: Comparing with sklearn implementation
- Data: Housing price dataset with multiple features
- Output: Model coefficients, performance metrics, scatter plots

## Target Audience
- Data science beginners
- Students learning ML fundamentals
